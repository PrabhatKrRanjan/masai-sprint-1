                    <p id="gradp1"> How to learn guitar step 1: Learn with a guitar thatâ€™s well suited to YOU<p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        There are dozens of different types of guitar and they play very differently. Some are easy to play. Some are difficult to play.
                        The guitar you choose to learn with has a huge influence on your chances of successfully learning the instrument. Any guitar is better than â€˜no guitarâ€™ of course, but ideally, you want a guitar that suits your body shape and size. This will make a profound and long-lasting difference to your guitar journey, so treat it seriously.

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 2: Learn to tune your guitar accurately and quickly</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        A good guitar tuner is a wise & worthwhile investment.
                        There are 4 main types: microphone-based tuners, vibration-based tuners, pedal tuners and smartphone apps.
                        Microphone-based tuners need to â€˜hearâ€™ the guitar notes to tune. (You can also plug in electric and electro-acoustic guitars on most modern tuners.)                       
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 3: Learn the names and numbers of your guitar strings</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Figuring out how to learn guitar will be difficult for you if you donâ€™t know which string is which!
                        Itâ€™s important for you to be able to communicate effectively not just with a teacher, but also with other musicians. (Especially if you want to play in a band some day.)   
                        Going from the thickest to the thinnest our guitar strings are: E A D G B E.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 4: Learn your basic chords</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Regardless of genre, if you want to know how to learn guitar, you MUST know your chords. (Even if you dream of being a solo-twiddling lead guitar legend you still need to know your chords.)
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 5: Learn how to strum</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Of all the different components that go into making music, the melody, the harmony, the formâ€¦ The most important of all is the RHYTHM.
                        We can make music that doesnâ€™t have melody, we can make music that doesnâ€™t have harmony and we can make music that doesnâ€™t have any set form, however, music cannot be made without RHYTHM.            
                        If you want to know how to learn guitar, you must be able to strum chords rhythmically.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 6: Learn how to hold your pick properly</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        As I mentioned earlier, itâ€™s a good idea to buy several different picks to experiment with. (Picks are cheap and small and they get lost all the time, so buy plenty of them.)
                        Most people find that when theyâ€™re first figuring out how to learn guitar they choose a softer pick. Then, as they progress they switch to a heavier pick as they want more control and accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 7: Make a list of songs you love</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Playing music you love isnâ€™t a luxury for a guitar learner. Itâ€™s required. So forget about learning stuff like â€˜happy birthdayâ€™ and â€˜twinkle twinkle little starâ€™. If your teacher wants you to play that stuff you should fire him immediately! ðŸ™‚
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 8: Find a good teacher</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        I alluded to this in the previous point. Itâ€™s important when learning any new skill to have the support and guidance of someone who is an expert.
                        It can take a few attempts to find the teacher thatâ€™s right for you. Thatâ€™s normal and you should expect it. Itâ€™s all part of understanding how to learn guitar.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 9: Practice in a smart way</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        The more Iâ€™ve played and the more Iâ€™ve taught thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve been increasingly convinced of.
                        The difference between good guitarists and not-so-good guitarists is not whether they have long fingers or short fingers or whether they have big hands or small hands or whether they come from a musical family or not. â€˜Talentâ€™ is a tiny part of the equation.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 10: Be patient with yourself</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Whenever we start learning a new skill we all want to be good straight away, but of course it doesnâ€™t work like that.
                        As you move forward in your journey of figuring out how to learn guitar there will be ups and downs.
                    </p>

                    <p id="gradp1">How to learn guitar step 11: Donâ€™t be discouraged by other people</p>
                    <p class="fontsize20">
                        Regarding other guitarists, what you have to remember is they most likely didnâ€™t get good at guitar to make you feel bad about yourself. More likely they got good at guitar because they wanted to feel good about themselves.
                        With this in mind, try and focus on doing the same. Donâ€™t view other guitarists as your competition and donâ€™t be distracted by what theyâ€™re doing. Concentrate on what youâ€™re doing and try and enjoy yourself.
